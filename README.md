# TOOLS FOR ANALYTICS_Final Project_Group 40
This repository is the final project for IEORE4501 Course: TOOLS FOR ANALYTICS.

## What has been implemented?
- We worked on a dataset consisting of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergencu services in the year 2020. The original dataset can be founded on: https://www.ny.gov/agencies/nyc-311.
-  In Top10.ipynb, we found top 10 causes of calls to 311 in ZIP code 10036, and calculated how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020.
-  In Parking.ipynb, we analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in 10036 than they are in general.
